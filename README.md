I’m a backend developer driven by a passion for building scalable applications and leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. With a strong focus on clean architecture and performance, I enjoy designing systems that are both efficient and maintainable.

I specialize in:

Node.js & Express.js for building robust backend services

TypeScript for writing clean, type-safe code

MongoDB and PostgreSQL for flexible and relational data storage

RESTful APIs and backend architecture design

I’m highly focused, diligent, and continuously improving my skills to stay current with modern software engineering practices. My goal is to contribute to meaningful products that improve daily life through thoughtful, impactful software solutions.
